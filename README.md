Computer Science & Mathematics | Security | Systems | Networking

I build security-focused systems that combine networking, probabilistic modeling,
and practical threat detection. My work emphasizes reproducibility, testing,
clear threat models, and realistic security assumptions. I am currently
expanding into hands-on cloud security and detection engineering.
