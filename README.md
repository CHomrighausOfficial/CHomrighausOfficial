I build security-focused systems that combine networking, probabilistic modeling,
and practical threat detection. My work emphasizes reproducibility, testing,
and clear threat models.

## Featured Projects

- Network Intrusion Detection System — packet analysis & alerting
- Serverless Security Log Analyzer — cloud-scale log correlation
- Password Entropy Analyzer — realistic password strength evaluation
- RNG Test Suite — statistical randomness testing
- Attack Probability Models — probabilistic security modeling
